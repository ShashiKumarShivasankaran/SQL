*Database Creation:
   - Utilized MySQL to create new databases to store and organize data.
   - Executed SQL commands to define the structure of the databases.

*Table Design and Creation:
   - Designed tables within the databases to represent specific entities or data categories.
   - Executed SQL queries to create tables with defined columns, data types, and constraints.

*Data Manipulation:
   - Employed SQL statements such as INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE to manipulate data within the tables.
   - Executed queries to add, modify, or remove records based on specific criteria.

*Data Retrieval:
   - Utilized SELECT statements to retrieve data from tables based on various conditions.
   - Employed SQL functions and clauses to filter, sort, and aggregate retrieved data.

*Indexing for Performance:
   - Created indexes on specific columns to enhance query performance.
   - Utilized indexing strategies to optimize the speed of data retrieval operations.

*Database Relationships:
   - Established relationships between tables using foreign key constraints.
   - Ensured data integrity and consistency through the implementation of referential integrity.

*Stored Procedures and Functions:
   - Developed and executed stored procedures for encapsulating and reusing SQL logic.
   - Implemented user-defined functions to perform specific calculations or data transformations.

*Normalization Techniques:
   - Applied normalization techniques to reduce data redundancy and improve database efficiency.
   - Ensured adherence to normalization forms for better data organization and maintenance.

*Database Backup and Restore:
   - Implemented regular database backups to prevent data loss.
   - Executed procedures for restoring databases in case of system failures or data corruption.

*Security Measures:
   - Implemented user authentication and authorization to control access to the databases.
   - Applied best practices for securing sensitive information, such as encrypting data and using secure connections.
